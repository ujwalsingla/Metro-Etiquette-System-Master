### Functionalities ###
* Types of ticket Booking:

  * Tokens- Tokens are used as single journey tickets. These are captured by gates during exit.This function will ask user for name, age, gender and route (from_ to _) and generate the fare and thereby type and number of tokens.      
  
  * Metro Travel Card (Smart Card)- This card stores some amount of money and through this you can travel without buying tokens. Every time you use this that much amount of money (with 10% concession) will get deducted. The card can also be topped up whenever it does not have sufficient amount.This will include registration for new card – asking user for general information, a nominal amount of Rs.50 and generating the card number, loading of tickets in the card, recharge (or top up) of card, present amount inquiry etc. 
  
  * Group Ticket-This is a paper ticket issued for a ‘Group’ of persons less than 25. The Group ticket is a single journey ticket.
